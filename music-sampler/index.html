 <p>Like a lot of rock bands, the Plain White T's started underground and made their way up to the big leagues. After the lead singer broke several vertebrae in a car crash in 1999, the band began writing more meaningful songs and taking its music more seriously in general. Soon after, the band released its first two albums: "Come On Over" in 2000 and "Stop" in 2002. "Stop" attracted the attention of Fearless Records, and the Plain White T's began touring.</p>

  <p>In 2005, the band released its third album: "All That We Needed." The album featured the band's most popular song to date, "Hey There Delilah." This song really put the Plain White T's on people's radars. The year after, the band released another album, "Every Second Counts." In 2007, the band released its fifth album, "Big Bad World." The two most popular songs on that album were "1, 2, 3, 4" and "Natural Disaster." That year, the band performed its single "Our Time Now" on the Nickelodeon show "iCarly." "Our Time Now" also became the theme song of ABC Family's show, "Greek."
  </p>

  <p>In 2009 and 2013, came the band's next two albums: "Wonders of the Younger," which featured one of the band's most popular songs "Rhythm of Love," and the band's EP, "Should've Gone to Bed," which in my personal opinon does not get enough credit for how amazing of an album it is. The band's most recent album is called "American Nights." This December, the Plain White T's will be celebrating their 20 years with an anniversary concert in their hometown, Chicago.
